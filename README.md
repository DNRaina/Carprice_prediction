# 🚗 Car Price Predictor with Lasso Regression 📊

Welcome to the Car Price Predictor repository! 🎉 This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting car prices using Lasso Regression. Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that performs L1 regularization, which can help with feature selection and regularization of the model. 🛠️

## Features 🛠️:
- **Lasso Regression**: Utilizes L1 regularization to penalize the absolute size of the coefficients.
- **Lasso Cross Validation**: Implements cross-validation to tune the regularization parameter for optimal performance.
- **StandardScaler**: Normalizes the feature variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Label Encoder**: Converts categorical variables into numerical values using label encoding.

## Dataset 📊:
The model is trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, named CarsData.csv 🚙. This dataset contains various attributes of cars such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.

## Files 📂:
- **Carsprice.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the car price predictor model.
- **CarsData.csv**: Sample dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Usage 🚀:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-predictor.git`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook car_price_predictor.ipynb`

## Future Work 🚀:
- Experiment with different regression techniques for comparison.
- Enhance feature engineering for improved model performance.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
